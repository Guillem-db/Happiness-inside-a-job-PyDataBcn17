#Happiness inside a job: A social netowork analysis
## PyData-Bcn-2017

This is the repository for the talk materials. It contains several example notebooks and the dataset used to perform the analysis explained in the talk. The slides are available [in google presentations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rcPADExVIk0d5GMb3x2mN1HBXaanNzor4_0U5Fp3oKQ/edit?usp=sharing). An [.odt file]() is also available in this repository

This is still under construction, and we will be uploading aditional material during the next days.
